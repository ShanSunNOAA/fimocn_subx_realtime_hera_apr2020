The purpose of code in this directory is to read in spectral coefficient
initial data from NCEP, transform to the underlying gaussian grid, and write
the results to a netcdf file suitable for plotting with e.g. ferret or
ncview. In order to run the executable, required input files are:

1) Initial data in the form of spectral coefficients 2) lat/lon information
(e.g. gfsltln_file)

To build:
  - Ensure $NETCDF points to a netcdf installation at least 3.6.3
  - Currently set up to use ifort but other compilers should work
  - Type "make"

To run:
  - Edit namelist file nl.spe2nc and set locations of desired spectral IC and
    gfsltln_file appropriately
  - setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS to the appropriate number of threads to
    use. spe2nc threads the spectral transform, though all netcdf output has
    to be done in a critical section because netcdf3.* does not allow
    parallel writes.
  - Run ./spe2nc < nl.spe2nc

Input source files come from various parts of the FIM source tree, so there
are many soft links to those files. Construction of the main program was done
to mimic as closely as possible what is done in ss2icos.F90
