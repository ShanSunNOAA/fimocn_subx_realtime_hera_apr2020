This is a linux port of the operational version of copygb (6/2004).
To compile, you need g95 (www.g95.org).

Differences from operational version:
   (1) some source code changes (number of underscores for C/f95)
   (2) one minor, yet to be fixed, unsupported f95 syntax.
   (3) conversion of w3lib to endian independent
   (4) no spectral conversion
